# Next.js Rendering Bug with Harmless Comment

This repository demonstrates a strange bug in Next.js where a seemingly harmless comment within a JSX expression causes the application to fail to render.

## Bug Description

A Next.js application is created with a simple JSX structure.  Adding a single-line comment within the JSX causes a rendering error, resulting in a blank page or an error in the console. Removing the comment resolves the issue.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Observe the error (blank page or console error).
5. Open `pages/index.js` and remove the comment within the JSX.
6. Refresh the page in your browser. The application should render correctly.

## Solution

The solution is simply to remove the comment from within the JSX expression. The underlying reason for this bug is unclear and might be related to a specific Next.js version or a nuanced interaction between the compiler and the JSX parser.  This report serves to document the issue and provide a potential workaround.
